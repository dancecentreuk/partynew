The Fame dance option is a lot of fun and an easy dance form for everyone to have a go at, you will strut your stuff with lots of attitude and learn a choreographed dance piece Fame i wanna live forever or to a choice of your own music from the fame video , you will also have lots of new dance moves to try out on the dance floor later in the evening.
